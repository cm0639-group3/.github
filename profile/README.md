- All team communications will be conducted through Microsoft Teams/Telegram or Calls/Sync in the aforementioned channels.
- Respond to messages and notifications in a timely manner (no more than three days).
2. Meetings:

  - Before merging, ensure that the code has been reviewed by at least one team member.
4. Code Quality:
  - Adhere to coding standards and guidelines specified in our project documentation. 
Us-'s local plugin to validate any code smells. See: https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/

7. Issue Tracking:
  - Use GitHub Issues for tracking tasks, bugs, and new features. *Preferably inside the Project created for -.*
  - Assign and prioritize issues, and regularly update their status.
8. Testing:
  - Write unit tests for all code changes.
  - Conduct regular integration testing to ensure microservices work seamlessly.
9. Versioning:
  - Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for versioning our software.
  - Clearly document any changes in the release notes.
10. Collaboration Etiquette:
