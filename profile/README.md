## Team Agreement Guideline

### Purpose:

This document outlines the guidelines and expectations for our collaborative online team working on the development of a software product using GitHub, microservices architecture, and communication through Microsoft Teams.
1. Communication:

a. All team communications will be conducted through Microsoft Teams/Telegram or Calls/Sync in the aforementioned channels.

b. Respond to messages and notifications in a timely manner (no more than three days).
2. Meetings:

a. Schedule regular team meetings for updates, discussions, and issue resolution.
We can have this as status updates in the telegram channel, less not create unnecessary overhead **be proactive**.

b. Use Microsoft Teams for virtual meetings and share an agenda beforehand.
3. GitHub Workflow:

a. Follow the Gitflow workflow for managing branches: main, dev, and feature branches.

b. Commit messages should be clear, concise, and follow a standardized format. Preferably using conventional commits, see: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

c. Before merging, ensure that the code has been reviewed by at least one team member.
4. Code Quality:

a. Adhere to coding standards and guidelines specified in our project documentation. 
Use SonarLint's local plugin to validate any code smells. See: https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/

b. Conduct regular code reviews to maintain code quality.
5. Microservices Architecture:

a. Clearly define the responsibilities and boundaries of each microservice.

b. Ensure that microservices communicate effectively through well-defined APIs.
6. Documentation:

a. Document code thoroughly, including functions, classes, and major components.

b. Maintain up-to-date project documentation on GitHub, including architecture diagrams.
See architecture repository: https://github.com/cm0639-group3/architecture 
7. Issue Tracking:

a. Use GitHub Issues for tracking tasks, bugs, and new features. *Preferably inside the Project created for the group.*

b. Assign and prioritize issues, and regularly update their status.
8. Testing:

a. Write unit tests for all code changes.

b. Conduct regular integration testing to ensure microservices work seamlessly.
9. Versioning:

a. Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for versioning our software.

b. Clearly document any changes in the release notes.
10. Collaboration Etiquette:

a. Be respectful in all communications and provide constructive feedback.

b. Encourage open discussions and the sharing of ideas.
11. Conflict Resolution:

a. Address conflicts promptly and professionally.

b. If conflicts persist, escalate the issue to the project lead or supervisor.
12. Timeline and Milestones:

a. Set realistic timelines for tasks and adhere to project milestones.

b. Regularly review progress and adjust timelines as necessary.
